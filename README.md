# Advance Image Generation App

## Project Description
This project is a Next.js-based web application that allows users to generate AI-powered images by providing text prompts. The app interfaces with the GPT-4 Image Generation API to create unique images based on user input. The application features a clean UI with state management, custom hooks, and API integration, while following React best practices.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will:

- Understand and implement React state management using useState
- Create and utilize custom React hooks
- Work with environment variables for API key management
- Implement API routes in Next.js applications
- Develop reusable React components
- Manage application state across multiple components
- Implement responsive UI design with Tailwind CSS
- Handle asynchronous operations in React
- Follow React best practices for component structure and organization

## Requirements
- Node.js (v14 or later)
- Next.js (v13 or later)
- React (v18 or later)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- GPT-4 API key (from RapidAPI)
- Modern web browser

## Best Practices Implemented
1. Component Organization

- Logical separation of layout and functional components
- Reusable components (ImageCard)
- Proper component typing with TypeScript

2. State Management

- Proper use of React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Custom hook for API calls (useFetchData)
- Type-safe state definitions

3. API Handling

- Server-side API route for secure API key usage
- Proper error handling
- Loading states

4. Security

- API keys stored in environment variables
Server-side API calls to protect keys
Input sanitization (though more could be added)

5. UI/UX

- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Loading indicators
- Image gallery with preview functionality
- Clean, intuitive interface

6. Type Safety

- TypeScript interfaces for all components and props
- Type-safe API responses
- Generic typing in custom hooks

## Key Features
1. Image Generation

- Text prompt input
- API integration with GPT-4 Image Generation
- Loading states during generation

2. Image Gallery

- History of generated images
- Thumbnail previews
- Click to view full image

3. Responsive UI

- Works on mobile and desktop
- Clean, modern design
- Intuitive navigation

4. Custom Hooks

- Reusable data fetching logic
- State management abstraction
- Error handling

## Development Notes
1. The project evolves through multiple versions (0x07 to 0x13), each adding new functionality:

- Basic setup and layout (0x07)
- State management (0x08)
- Environment configuration (0x09)
- API integration (0x10)
- Image tracking (0x11)
- Custom hooks (0x12-0x13)

2. The final version demonstrates:

- Clean separation of concerns
- Reusable components and hooks
- Proper TypeScript implementation
- Good React patterns

3. For production use, additional features could include:

- User authentication
- Persistent storage of generated images
- More advanced error handling
- Image editing capabilities
- Social sharing features
